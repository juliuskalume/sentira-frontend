  <h1>How to Build a Mood-Based Reading Routine (Emotional Reading Habits Guide)</h1>
  <p><strong>A gentle approach to reading more by following your emotions, not rigid goals.</strong></p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Mood-Based Reading Routines Work</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>mood-based reading routine</strong> adapts to your inner world instead of forcing you into schedules that don’t match your energy.
    When you choose books based on how you feel, you naturally:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>read more consistently</li>
    <li>avoid reading slumps</li>
    <li>reduce guilt around unfinished books</li>
    <li>feel emotionally supported by your reading life</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mood Check-Ins: The Foundation of an Emotional Reading Habit</h2>
  <p>
    Before choosing a book, pause and ask:
    <em>“How do I feel right now and what do I want from a story?”</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tired → soft, cozy, short chapters</li>
    <li>Anxious → comforting or distraction-heavy books</li>
    <li>Inspired → essays, non-fiction, meaningful literary fiction</li>
    <li>Restless → page-turners, plot-driven stories</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    MoodShelf makes this easy:
    <a href="https://moodshelf.vercel.app/">do a quick mood check-in</a> and get tailored suggestions instantly.

  <h2>Pairing Your Mood With the Time of Day</h2>
  <p>
    Your emotional state changes through the day. Use it to your advantage:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morning:</strong> calm focus → light non-fiction or inspiring reads</li>
    <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> distracted → audiobooks or easy fiction</li>
    <li><strong>Evening:</strong> tired → cozy, gentle, low-stakes stories</li>
    <li><strong>Late night:</strong> reflective → memoirs, poetry, introspective reads</li>
  </ul>
