# Sentira by sentirax

Sentira is a mood based book recommendation web app that helps readers choose what to read based on how they feel, not just genres, ratings, or trends.

Instead of endless scrolling and decision fatigue, Sentira starts with your emotional state and suggests books that align with that mood, whether you want something calming, uplifting, reflective, or immersive.

## Why Sentira

Choosing a book is often harder than reading one. Most recommendation systems focus on popularity or categories, but reading is deeply emotional. Sentira was built to bridge that gap by making mood the starting point of the recommendation process.

The goal is to make reading feel intentional, personal, and calm.
