<h1>About MoodShelf</h1>

<p><strong>MoodShelf</strong> is a simple, intuitive tool designed for readers who choose their next book based on how they feel. Instead of forcing yourself into a rigid reading list, MoodShelf helps you flow with your emotions and pick books that resonate with your mood at the moment.</p>

<h2>Why MoodShelf Exists</h2>

<p>Many readers find that their enjoyment of a book depends heavily on their emotional state. You may crave a cozy escape one day and something intense or thought-provoking the next. MoodShelf embraces this idea by letting you:</p>

  <li>Discover book suggestions that match how you feel</li>
  <li>Build a personal shelf of your current and future reads</li>
  <li>Track how your reading habits shift over time</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s an experience built on the idea that reading is personal — and your mood is part of the story.</p>
