  <h1>The Complete Guide to Mood Reading (Mood-Based Reading Explained)</h1>
  <p><strong>Everything you need to know about mood reading, building a mood-based TBR, and choosing books that match your emotions.</strong></p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>What Is Mood Reading? (Definition)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Mood reading</strong>—also called <strong>mood-based reading</strong>—is the practice of choosing what to read based on your
    current emotional state rather than a fixed TBR list or reading schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've ever picked up a book you "should" read and immediately bounced off because it didn't match
    how you were feeling, you've experienced the core insight behind mood reading:
    <em>the right book at the wrong moment still feels wrong.</em>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Mood-Based Reading Works Better Than Rigid TBRs</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional reading plans often fail because they ignore your emotional landscape.
    Mood-based reading respects your attention, energy, and inner state, helping prevent:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>reading slumps</li>
    <li>DNF guilt</li>
    <li>decision fatigue</li>
    <li>progress anxiety</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When you choose books that match your mood, reading becomes restorative instead of stressful.

  <h2>How to Start Mood-Based Reading (Step-by-Step)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Pause and identify your mood.</strong> Use simple words: tired, inspired, cozy, overwhelmed.</li>
    <li><strong>Decide what you want from a book emotionally:</strong> comfort, distraction, challenge, energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose books whose tone matches your emotional need.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Allow yourself to switch books.</strong> Mood reading is flexible, not fixed.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How to Build a Mood-Based TBR (Templates + Examples)</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>mood-based TBR</strong> groups books by emotional vibe instead of by month or genre.
  </p>

  <h3>Mood-Based TBR Categories</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cozy & Comfort</li>
    <li>Intense & Immersive</li>
    <li>Short & Light</li>
    <li>Brainy & Reflective</li>
    <li>Emotional & Vulnerable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Add 5–10 books to each mood bucket. When you sit down to read, pick from the mood that matches your moment.
